HOW TO CREATE A SIMPLE API CHANNEL METHOD (No Liquid Handling Actions)
========================================================================

You DON'T need to add aspiration/dispense actions! You just need a method with an API Channel action.

THE PROBLEM: The current "demo" method may not have the right API Channel configuration for simulation mode.

SOLUTION: Create a simple method that ONLY opens an API channel, without liquid handling actions.

STEPS IN FLUENTCONTROL:
======================

1. Open FluentControl in Simulation Mode

2. Go to Methods tab

3. Create New Method: "Simple_API_Channel"

4. In Method Editor:
   - Add ONE action: "API Channel"
   - Configure it as:
     * Action Type: "Start API Channel"
     * Mode: "Wait Indefinitely" or "Loop"
     * NO other actions needed!

5. Save the method

WHY THIS SHOULD WORK:
====================

- In non-simulation mode, you had a simple API method
- In simulation mode, you need a similar method that opens the channel
- The API Channel action keeps the method running indefinitely
- PyFluent can then send commands through this channel
- No liquid handling actions needed - just the channel opener

TEST IT:
=======

After creating this method:

1. Run: python tests/diagnose_method.py
2. Look for "Simple_API_Channel" in the list
3. It should stay running (not complete immediately)
4. Then run: python tests/run_protocol_simulation.py

If this doesn't work, the issue might be that simulation mode requires methods with actual actions to simulate. In that case, we'd need to add minimal actions (like move to a position) that can be controlled via the API channel.
